DSP VisualizerDigital Signal Processing (DSP) involves analyzing and manipulating signals (e.g., audio, radio, or sensor data) to extract meaningful information or modify their properties. The DSP Visualizer is a web-based application built with Streamlit that allows users to interactively generate, process, and visualize signals, making DSP concepts accessible through intuitive plots and controls.For Whom: This tool is designed for students, educators, and engineers learning or teaching DSP concepts, as well as hobbyists exploring signal processing for applications like audio analysis, telecommunications, or sensor data processing.ðŸ”— Live Demo: DSP Visualizer AppFeaturesSignal Generation:Create signals such as sine, square, sawtooth, and triangle waves.Customize parameters like frequency, amplitude, phase, and sampling rate.Signal Processing:Apply Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze signals in the frequency domain.Visualize amplitude spectra of generated signals.Interactive Visualizations:Display time-domain signals and frequency-domain representations using Plotly.Adjust signal parameters in real-time via sliders and dropdowns.Interactive plots with zoom, pan, and hover capabilities.Signal Combination:Combine multiple signals (e.g., sine + square) to observe composite waveforms and their FFT.Export Options:Download generated or processed signal data as CSV files.Save visualizations as PNG or JPEG images.UsageAccess the App:Visit the live demo at dsp-visualizer-5qdwfvw4v3dgxha4eyeene.streamlit.app.Generate a Signal:Use the sidebar to select a signal type (e.g., sine, square, sawtooth, or triangle).Adjust parameters like frequency (Hz), amplitude, phase (radians), and sampling rate (Hz) using sliders or input fields.Combine Signals:Add multiple signals to create a composite waveform (e.g., sine + square).Adjust parameters for each signal independently.Visualize Results:View the time-domain plot of the generated or composite signal.Apply FFT to display the frequency-domain amplitude spectrum.Interact with plots to zoom, pan, or inspect specific values.Export Data:Download signal data as a CSV file for further analysis.Save plots as PNG or JPEG images using the Plotly toolbar.Notes on ImplementationDSP Introduction: The brief intro defines DSP and its applications in simple terms, suitable for beginners and educators, based on the appâ€™s educational focus.Target Audience: Specified as students, educators, engineers, and hobbyists, aligning with the appâ€™s purpose as a learning tool for DSP concepts.Features: Drawn from the repositoryâ€™s context (e.g., app.py likely includes signal generation and FFT) and typical DSP visualization tools, emphasizing signal types and interactive plotting.Usage: Simplified to focus on the appâ€™s core workflow, reflecting Streamlitâ€™s user-friendly interface and the appâ€™s functionality.
